# 03 — Nullability & the Type System

Nullable reference types are this language's first test suite, and the flow analysis runs on every build. This chapter is about not lying to it: every rule below closes a hole through which a `null`, an unproven cast, or a `dynamic` value could reach domain logic that trusts the annotations. The flag is switched on in chapter [01](./01-formatting-and-tooling.md); here is the discipline that makes it mean something.

## What good looks like

```csharp
public sealed record User(UserId Id, string Email, IReadOnlyList<string> Roles);

public static class UserParser
{
    // Takes nullable, untrusted input; returns a non-null domain type or a typed failure (3.2, 3.6).
    public static Result<User, string> Parse(UserDto? dto)
    {
        if (dto is null) return new Result<User, string>.Err("dto was null");
        if (string.IsNullOrWhiteSpace(dto.Email)) return new Result<User, string>.Err("email required");

        var id = UserId.From(dto.Id);                 // validated factory mints the brand (3.7)
        var roles = dto.Roles ?? [];                  // null from the wire collapses to empty, here (3.4)
        return new Result<User, string>.Ok(new User(id, dto.Email, roles));
    }
}
```

The boundary receives a nullable `UserDto?` and either returns a fully non-null `User` or a typed failure — no `!`, no `default!`, no `dynamic` (3.1, 3.3, 3.5). The one place a `null` from the wire is handled is explicit and local (3.4). `UserId` is a branded value type minted by a validating factory (3.7), and every public field is a `record` property carrying value semantics (3.8). The interior never sees an absence value it did not ask for.

## Rules

### 3.1 — Honour the nullable annotations; never silence a nullable warning with the project file.

**Reasoning, step by step:**
1. With `<Nullable>enable</Nullable>` on (chapter [01](./01-formatting-and-tooling.md)), the compiler tracks whether each reference may be `null` and warns (CS8600–CS8655) when you dereference, return, or assign something it cannot prove non-null. Those warnings are the analysis doing its job; a clean build under them is a real guarantee, not a vibe.
2. The only honest responses to a nullable warning are to handle the `null`, to narrow it away, or to teach the analyzer a fact it cannot see with a nullable attribute (3.6). Silencing it with `#nullable disable`, a blanket `<WarningsNotAsErrors>`, or `!` (3.3) does not make the value non-null; it makes the eventual `NullReferenceException` land far from the suppression.

**Worked example:**
```csharp
string? maybe = Lookup(key);
int length = maybe.Length;               // CS8602 — possible null deref; do not suppress
int safe = maybe?.Length ?? 0;           // good — the null is handled in place
```
**Enforcement:** CS86xx promoted to errors by `<TreatWarningsAsErrors>` (chapter [01](./01-formatting-and-tooling.md)); `#nullable disable` is a review finding.

### 3.2 — Receive untrusted input as nullable; parse it into a non-null domain type at the boundary.

**Reasoning, step by step:**
1. Everything crossing a boundary — a deserialized DTO, a config value, a database row, a query-string parameter — can be absent, so its type should admit that: `UserDto?`, `string?`. Annotating the boundary honestly forces the caller to deal with absence exactly once, at the edge, instead of propagating a maybe-null through the interior.
2. The parse step turns the nullable, loosely typed input into a non-null, fully validated domain type (a `record`, a branded primitive). After the boundary, the interior works with types whose annotations promise non-null, so the flow analysis stops complaining and the checks are not repeated. Parse, don't validate — return the proven type, not a bool (chapter [06](./06-types-and-data-modeling.md)).

**Worked example:**
```csharp
public static Order ToDomain(OrderDto? dto)
{
    ArgumentNullException.ThrowIfNull(dto);           // boundary asserts presence once
    return new Order(OrderId.From(dto.Id), dto.Lines ?? []);
}
```
**Enforcement:** review at boundary modules; `CA1062` (validate public arguments).

### 3.3 — Ban the null-forgiving `!` outside declared bridges and proven post-conditions.

**Reasoning, step by step:**
1. `expr!` tells the compiler "trust me, this is not null" and switches off the check, exactly like an unverified cast. When you are wrong, the `NullReferenceException` surfaces downstream where the cause is no longer visible. It is the nullable analog of `as` without a proof, and a recorded tightening of the runtime's more pragmatic stance (see the [README](./README.md) ledger).
2. The honest alternatives come first: handle the null, narrow with `is not null` (3.4), or — when *you* know a member is non-null after a method runs but the compiler cannot follow — teach it with a nullable attribute (3.6) rather than asserting with `!`. The only sanctioned `!` sites are a declared interop/bridge to un-annotated third-party code and a test asserting a value is present, each with a why-comment.

**Worked example:**
```csharp
var name = FindUser(id)!.Name;                 // bad — `!` hides a possible null
if (FindUser(id) is { } user) name = user.Name; // good — narrowed, no forgiveness needed
```
**Enforcement:** review rejects `!` absent a why-comment; an analyzer rule (e.g. `CA1508`/custom) can flag bare null-forgiving operators.

### 3.4 — Narrow with the weakest tool that works: `is null` / `is not null`, then pattern, then a typed check.

**Reasoning, step by step:**
1. Narrowing is how a nullable becomes usable, and the tools order from safest to most error-prone. `is null` and `is not null` are the canonical guards — they cannot be fooled by an overloaded `==`, and they read as English. A property or positional pattern (`is { Length: > 0 } s`) narrows and binds in one step, so the non-null value is in scope without a second access.
2. Prefer these to `!= null` comparisons and to re-fetching a value you have already null-checked. Convert a `null` arriving from an external contract (`??`) into the interior's chosen absence — usually an empty collection or a domain default — at the boundary, so the interior speaks one absence dialect.

**Worked example:**
```csharp
if (node is not null && node.Value is { } value)   // narrows node, then binds non-null value
    Process(value);
var roles = dto.Roles ?? [];                        // external null collapses to empty here
```
**Enforcement:** `IDE0041` (use `is null`); review of `== null`/`!= null` in new code.

### 3.5 — Ban `dynamic`; accept `object` only at the edge and pattern-match it inward.

**Reasoning, step by step:**
1. `dynamic` disables the type system for the value and everything derived from it, deferring every member resolution to runtime, where a typo becomes a `RuntimeBinderException` instead of a compile error. It is the C# equivalent of `any`, and one `dynamic` infects its call chain.
2. When a value genuinely arrives untyped — a `JsonElement`, a COM object, a reflection result — receive it as `object?` or the specific weakly typed carrier (`JsonElement`), then pattern-match or parse it into a domain type before the interior sees it (3.2). `object` forces a check; `dynamic` forbids one.

**Worked example:**
```csharp
dynamic d = Parse(raw); return d.user.name;        // bad — resolved at runtime, typos uncaught
object? o = Parse(raw);                             // good — object forces a narrowing
return o is JsonElement { ValueKind: JsonValueKind.Object } e ? e.GetProperty("name").GetString() : null;
```
**Enforcement:** review; `dynamic` is disallowed in domain assemblies, permitted only in declared interop bridges.

### 3.6 — Teach flow analysis with nullable attributes instead of asserting with `!`.

**Reasoning, step by step:**
1. Sometimes a method establishes a nullability fact the compiler cannot infer: `TryGet` sets its `out` parameter non-null exactly when it returns `true`; an `Initialize` method guarantees a field non-null afterward. Reaching for `!` at every call site to express this scatters unchecked assertions everywhere.
2. State the fact once, on the method, with a nullable attribute — `[NotNullWhen(true)]`, `[MemberNotNull(nameof(_field))]`, `[NotNullIfNotNull]` — and the analyzer then propagates it to *every* caller automatically and checks that your implementation actually upholds it. The contract is declared in one verified place rather than trusted in many unverified ones.

**Worked example:**
```csharp
public bool TryResolve(string key, [NotNullWhen(true)] out User? user) // teaches every caller
{
    user = _cache.GetValueOrDefault(key);
    return user is not null;
}
if (TryResolve(key, out var u)) Use(u);    // u is non-null here — no `!` needed
```
**Enforcement:** review prefers a nullable attribute over `!`; the analyzer verifies the annotated contract.

### 3.7 — Brand domain primitives so the compiler refuses to confuse them.

**Reasoning, step by step:**
1. In a structural sense every `string` and every `int` is interchangeable, so `UserId`, `OrderId`, and a raw `Guid` are one type and the compiler will pass any where another is meant. Wrap them in a `readonly record struct` with a private constructor and a validating factory; the value is now nominally distinct and can only be created through validation.
2. The wrapper costs one allocation-free struct and earns two things: a swapped-argument bug becomes a compile error, and the only place the raw value is accepted is the factory, which is the single sanctioned spot to validate. This pairs with 3.2 — the boundary parses the wire value into the brand, and the interior trusts it.

**Worked example:**
```csharp
public readonly record struct UserId
{
    public Guid Value { get; }
    private UserId(Guid value) => Value = value;
    public static UserId From(Guid value) =>
        value != Guid.Empty ? new UserId(value) : throw new ArgumentException("empty id", nameof(value));
}
```
**Enforcement:** convention in domain modules; the distinct type makes mismatches compile errors.

### 3.8 — Choose `record`, `record struct`, or `class` by value semantics, not by habit.

**Reasoning, step by step:**
1. The type kind encodes how a value behaves, so choose it from the value's nature. A `record` (reference) is the default for immutable data with value equality and `with` updates. A `readonly record struct` is for a small (≈ ≤ 16 bytes), immutable value used in hot paths, where avoiding the heap allocation matters and copying is cheap (chapter [15](./15-performance.md)). A `class` is reserved for entities with identity and lifecycle — things you open, mutate under control, and close (chapter [13](./13-resource-management.md)).
2. Reach for a plain mutable `class` only when identity and in-place mutation are the point; everywhere else immutability is the default (root rule 3). Avoid large mutable structs — they copy on every assignment and surprise everyone — and never expose a public mutable struct field, since you mutate the copy, not the original.

**Worked example:**
```csharp
public sealed record Customer(CustomerId Id, string Name);          // immutable data, value equality
public readonly record struct Point(double X, double Y);            // small hot-path value, no heap
public sealed class Connection : IAsyncDisposable { /* identity + lifecycle */ }
```
**Enforcement:** review of type-kind choice; `CA1815`/`CA1822` and the immutability rules of chapter [06](./06-types-and-data-modeling.md).
